## Pillars of OOP

**1. Encapsulation**

- packing of data and functions operating on that data into a single component

**2. Abstraction**

- hiding the complexity and only showing the essential features/details

**3. Inheritance**

- defines a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class

**4. Polymorphism**

- diff object classes can share same method names, but can act differently
